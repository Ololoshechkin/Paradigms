ITMO University paradigms course__
__
1. Getting programm arguments in command line, parsing them not to contain whitespace symbols and printing their sum__
Modification : parsing in decimal and in octadecimal radix__
__
2. Design by contract(DbC). It contains 2 implimentations of binsearch algorithm with full contract in comments.__
Modification : number of elements equal to some number.__
__
3. ArrayQueue implimentation in 3 different OOP concepts: 1) class methods, 2) ADT (OOP without syntax sugar of missing the__
first argument), 3) classical OOP implementation__
Modification: Deque methods__
__
4. LinkedQueue. Implementation of common interface and abstract class of task3 ArrayQueue and LinkedQueue.__
Modification: filter(predicate) and map(function) methods to both of classes.__
__
5. Expressions parser. Programm is a parser of any expression containing integer constants, variables(x,y,z), binary operations__
(+, -, *, /, <<, >>) and unary (abs, square, -). Implementation contains classes allowing to build any combination of operators and priorities in math expressions context.__
__
6. Modification of 5th task. Now programm also throws exceptions and prints informative messages to user. Also some operators__
added : unary(log2, pow2) and binary(min, max with sintax "a max b" and "a min b").__
__
7. JavaScript Functional expressions parser. Expressions should be performed in poland notation.__
Operations : +, -, *, /, negate, min3, max5.__
Variables : x, y, z, u, v, w__
Literals : x, y, z__
Constants :  pi, e__
__
8. JavaScript Object Oriented expressions parser.__
Operations : +, -, *, /, negate, pow, log, sqr, sqrt.__
Variables : x, y, z, u, v, w__
Supports dirivatives (.diff() method) of each expression__
Supports toString() method__
Supports simplify() method - simplifies each expression (calculating constant expressions, deleting *1, *0, +0 etc.)__
