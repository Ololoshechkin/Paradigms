ITMO University paradigms course

1. Getting programm arguments in command line, parsing them not to contain whitespace symbols and printing their sum
Modification : parsing in decimal and in octadecimal radix,

2. Design by contract(DbC). It contains 2 implimentations of binsearch algorithm with full contract in comments.
Modification : number of elements equal to some number.

3. ArrayQueue implimentation in 3 different OOP concepts: 1) class methods, 2) ADT (OOP without syntax sugar of missing the
first argument), 3) classical OOP implementation
Modification: Deque methods

4. LinkedQueue. Implementation of common interface and abstract class of task3 ArrayQueue and LinkedQueue.
Modification: filter(predicate) and map(function) methods to both of classes.

5. Expressions parser. Programm is a parser of any expression containing integer constants, variables(x,y,z), binary operations
(+, -, *, /, <<, >>) and unary (abs, square, -). Implementation contains classes allowing to build any combination of operators
and priorities in math expressions context.

6. Modification of 5th task. Now programm also throws exceptions and prints informative messages to user. Also some operators
added : unary(log2, pow2) and binary(min, max with sintax "a max b" and "a min b").
